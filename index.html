            <p>In our modern digital era, it is not uncommon to see someone with a false identity; whether it be on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook or any Online Social Network (OSN), fabricated accounts will always be present. Most people find fake identities malicious and destructive, and some accounts are created with malicious intent and serve that exact purpose. However, I think that creating a fake online identity with the intent to evade online footprints and create anonymity is meritable and sometimes even necessary. As a person who grew up in a digital world, I’ve always been fascinated with creating a fake identity to be used for convenience and anonymity, but I also wanted to see how far I could take this without getting in any legal troubles.<br><br>A fake online identity is defined as a fabricated online presence and social identity that an Internet user establishes in online communities, websites, and OSNs. Essentially I just want to create a fake person for the lolz and Xds. And thus Jonathan Yun was created. A Journalistic Yuppification Utility Networked Project. JYUN for short but also Jonathan Yun because fuck you; I can do whatever I want.<br><br>This will be a documentation and report on the creation of Jonathan Yun and what I plan to do with him.<br><br>I plan to just make a Jonathan Yun bot on discord because I want to. I also want to try to upgrade my programming skills to make something I will be proud to look back on. Hopefully Jonathan Yun becomes a very good bot that will make my friends happy and become God.</p>

            <p>Jonathan Yun's hot sister. But let's hear from Jonathan Yun and what he thinks of Jennifer Yun.<br><br>She is always there for me, suggesting and supporting me. She is one of the best advisors in my life. She never asks me to do anything bad. She has a very good brain to make judgments, and she never let her make the wrong decisions. She is a bright student too. In her school time, she was top everywhere from grades one to ten. She never looked back and got admitted to engineering college. She is performing well there and hoping for the best for the future.<br><br>I consider my sister to be the role model of my life. I aspire to be like her. And that’s why I am following and learning the good and bad things from her. I usually take tips from her about most things in my life. And she does help me without any hesitation. There are a few reasons why I do look up to her.<br><br>The most important thing is that she has nonegativity around her. I find her to be super positive every time. I love hersmiling face; she never gets too worried or stressed anytime. And that thinggives me so much inspiration and motivation. Her charms and presence make meforget all the problems and pains. I feel at peace when I spend time with her.<br><br>Another reason is her amazing studying skills. She is a very good student. I want to be a good student like her andwant to perform well in every stage of my life. My parents are happy with her helpful mentality. Not only in the family, but she is helpful in college too. I found a few girls came to our house for free tuition. She even helps them with her notes.</p>
